        <p>I am currently learning how to do front-end web design. I know I have
          a lot to learn, but I'll catch on eventually. I should print out some
          cheat sheets if I want to have everything readily available, but there's a
          lot to read through to find what I need immediately. I'm okay with doing
          things the hard way or taking a little more time while I am learning, but,
          at some point, I will need to know these shortcut keys. I'm determined to
          get this shit done, and get it done correctly.
